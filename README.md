## About The Project:

This application is a business card website for the commercial organization, that was created by my own design.

On the website, a user can get acquainted with the history of the company, learn about products and production technologies. He can also find the supplier's contacts or leave his own in the feedback form.
The site saves information from the feedback form in a Google sheet for further analysis by the company manager (it was the customer's wish).
